\problem{2.3-2}

 The plane structures shown consist of rigid weightless bars connected by linear springs, each of stiffness $k$.
 Degrees of freedom are horizontal translations \(u_i\) and small rotations \(\theta_i\) for $i = 1, 2,$ as shown.
 Vertical motion and out-of-plane displacements are not allowed.
 In each case determine the 4 by 4 structure stiffness matrix in terms of $k$ and $b$.
