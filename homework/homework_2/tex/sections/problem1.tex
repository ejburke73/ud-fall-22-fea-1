\problem{2.2-2}

In each of the two plane structures shown, rigid blocks are connected by linear springs.
Imagine that only horizontal displacements are allowed. 
In each case, write the structure equilibrium equations \([K]\left\{D\right\} = \left\{R\right\}\) in terms of spring stiffnesses \(k_i\), displacement d.o.f. \(u_i\), and applied loads \(F_i\).
